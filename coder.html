                <p>With Myspace and it's HTML customisable pages essentially dead, and my university days - during which I had a small, largely inconsequential web-design class amongst my sound and video studies - far behind me, I thought my days of coding we long gone. Then last year I enrolled in a Computer Science course with Code Nation, determined to start a new career. I took to it quickly, spending hours out of class playing with the concepts I was learning during lessons. I found I had a real passion for software development, particularly in the front end.</br></br>
                For group projects I worked together with my team to develop our complicated ideas into workable Javascript. I stepped in to help develop the HTML and CSS for the project when I could to make it more presentable. I designed and coded this portfolio through a number of iterations until I got it looking how I wanted it to.
                Most importantly, I enjoy it!</br></br>
                I've a lot more to learn and I'm eager to do so.</p>
