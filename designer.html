                <p>Evidenced by this spectacular Portfolio you're perusing, I've always had an instinct for design. I've always enjoyed drawing but I found this instinct was best realised in my late teenage years when I started using Photoshop to make artwork to accompany the music I was making. Ever since I have been creating artworks for my albums, EPs and singles, whether it be entirely digitally or - as I have taken to more in the last few years - digitally manipulating photographs.
                <br><br>That being said, I never gave up on design in other areas. I hand drew the logo for my first band, I've made t shirts and patches for my musical projects, have always enjoyed customising clothes, and made efforts to make my hand-writing a singular thing of beauty.
                <br><br>The arms of 'design' are many and far-reaching and I feel I could go on but suffice to say, I have a good eye for good design.</p>
