            <div class="about">
                <p>I've had an interest in music since I was a child, trying lessons on violin, trombone, keyboard and saxophone, before settling on guitar, which I have been playing for more than half my life at this point. I properly started writing and recording music when I was sixteen and enrolled in a Music Technology course at St. Helens College. There my teachers gave me some software and I quickly started making low quality recording of the many instrumentals I came up with on guitar.
                </br></br>I had a few attempts and completing proper releases under the pseudonym, Maniacal Laughter, but it would be a few years until, while at the University of Salford I would release my first proper single as Dr. Nowt. In 2012 "Hello" was produced for my dissertation, alongside a music video, promotional materials and a website (not nearly as nice a website as this one. See the 'Coder' section). Shortly after graduating I wrote and produced my first EP, "Population Control" essentially as an exercise in testing my vocal ability.
                </br></br>It took me a long time to get there, but now that I'd released my first EP and had some confidence in my vocals, I started releasing music much more regularly. Between 2012 and now, I have released an EP or an album every year but two, those two years being when I was traveling.
                </br></br>In 2022 I started performing live, my second gig being at Manchester Punk Festival, and in the summer I realeased a video EP of a live recording from my practice space. In February of 2023 I released a new single, "Top Hat", from an upcoming EP. The rest of the year holds more gigging and recording for Dr. Nowt, and I hope to begin recording a new album later in the year.
                </br></br>Outside of this project, I am beginning to persue other areas of music, such as scoring and creating stock music under the name Nash Matthews. I have always enjoyed adding orchestral instrumentation into my music and have become quite adept at composing for these instruments. I hope to build a collection of instrumental tracks for use in short films, Youtube videos, etc. and eventually write scores for film.
                </br></br>To the right you can find examples of my work, including the Dr. Nowt Spotify page, a Nash Matthews instrumental track, and my 2022 video EP, "Live from the Third Room".</p>
